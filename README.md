# LexA-Index (AI Word Overuse Explorer)

The Explorer lets you explore words that are systematically overused by AI models compared to human baselines, across multiple languages, registers, and AI models.

This repository contains:
- the website (`index.html`, `about.html`)
- the CSV outputs (as a 7z, unzip in the top level folder)
- a small script to build website-ready json's from the cvs's (`build_data.py`).


## What this is for

With this repo, you can:
- reproduce the website data build locally,
- inspect the underlying csv's,
- and interactively visualise results for all available language/register/model combinations.

Motivation and background are summarised on the About page. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}


## Quick start

- Clone
- Unpack the .7z
- Generate them from the CSVs with:

```bash
python3 build_data.py
```

- Serve locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open:

* [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)


## Key metrics include:

* LAS Score: Laid out in our paper
* OPM: occurrences per million tokens (AI and human)
* Ratio: AI OPM / human OPM
